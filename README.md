## Troubleshooting

1. **Issue**: **My Insta Assistant** is not scraping reels or shorts correctly.

   **Solution**: Ensure that the Instagram account usernames and YouTube channel links in `config.py` are correct and publicly accessible. Also, make sure that your YouTube API key is valid and has not exceeded the quota limits.

2. **Issue**: **My Insta Assistant** is not posting reels and shorts to my Instagram account.

   **Solution**: Verify that your Instagram account credentials in `config.py` are correct and that your account has not been banned or restricted. Additionally, check the `POSTING_INTERVAL_IN_MIN` and `SCRAPER_INTERVAL_IN_MIN` settings to ensure they are set to appropriate values.

3. **Issue**: I am receiving an error when running **My Insta Assistant** with Docker.

   **Solution**: Make sure you have properly installed and configured Docker on your system. Double-check the Docker build and run commands to ensure they are executed correctly. If the issue persists, consider running **My Insta Assistant** without Docker.
